# Scala OOPs Concepts 

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** demonstrating the key **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Scala**. It is designed for learners who want to understand and practice Scala’s OOP principles with clear examples.

##  Contents

The notebook covers the following OOP concepts in Scala:

* **Classes & Objects**
* **Constructors**
* **Encapsulation**
* **Inheritance**
* **Polymorphism (Compile-time & Runtime)**
* **Abstraction**
* **Traits**
* **Case Classes**
* **Companion Objects**
* **Anonymous & Inner Classes**

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/) installed (2.13.x or higher recommended)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) with [Almond Scala kernel](https://almond.sh/)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alinapradhan/scala-oops-concepts.git
   cd scala-oops-concepts
   ```
2. Install Jupyter + Almond Scala kernel:

   ```bash
   coursier launch almond --scala 2.13 --install
   ```
3. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook SCALA_OOPs_Concepts_.ipynb
   ```

##  Usage

* Open the notebook in Jupyter
* Run each cell step by step to see OOP concepts in action
* Modify code snippets to experiment with different Scala OOP features
